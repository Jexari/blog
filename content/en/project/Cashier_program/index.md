<p align="justify">The cashier program includes a database that stores information about cashiers, products and their bar codes. It provides automation of sales processes and allows cashiers to quickly and efficiently perform transactions at the checkout. With the help of the database, the cashier can easily search for information about products, which significantly speeds up the process of making purchases. Each product has a unique bar code that links it to information about the price, availability in stock and other characteristics. The database also stores data about cashiers, which allows you to track their work, as well as keep records of sales, ensuring the accuracy and transparency of financial transactions. The program has an imitation of a cash drawer. Accounting of deposits and withdrawals of funds is kept.</p>
