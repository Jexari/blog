Python was the first programming language I was introduced to. I taught him exclusively for passing the exam (EGE), but later I began to go to additional courses. I was attracted to it not only by its simplicity, but also by the demand and conciseness of this language. C++, which I still have a personal dislike for, seems big, complex, and very tricky. Today, I try to improve my skills not only in Python, but also in other programming languages, and I also continue to get acquainted with markup languages (HTML and Markdown).
