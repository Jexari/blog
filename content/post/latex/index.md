# About my pastime in summer
I got the opportunity to study under the retraining program in the direction of "Fundamentals of Software Testing". The training will take place in absentia (online) at the University of Inopolis. I am very interested in the profession of a tester. I am also looking for an internship where I can learn more about this profession.
